A package of Ts.ED framework. See website: https://tsed.io/#/tutorials/seq

## Installation

Run npm command (or yarn):
```bash
npm install --save @tsed/seq bunyan bunyan-seq @types/bunyan @types/bunyan-seq
```

Then add the following configuration in your [ServerLoader](https://tsed.io/api/common/server/components/ServerLoader.md):

```typescript
import {ServerLoader, ServerSettings} from "@tsed/common";
import "@tsed/seq"; // import seq Ts.ED module

@ServerSettings({
  rootDir: __dirname,
  seq: {
    url: "http://localhost:5341"
  }
})
export class Server extends ServerLoader {

}
```
> Note: Seq module use the [ts-log-debug](https://github.com/TypedProject/ts-log-debug) as a default system logger

> Note: Seq module use the log level from the [LoggerSettings](https://tsed.io/api/common/config/interfaces/ILoggerSettings.md) (default level is debug)

## Example

```typescript
import {Controller, Get, Post} from "@tsed/common";
import {$log} from "ts-log-debug";

@Controller('/calendars')
export class Calendar {
    
    @Get('/:id')
    async getCalendar(@QueryParam() id: string): Promise<CalendarModel> {
      $log.info(id);
    }
   
}
```

Then we should see the log in the Seq panel (by default `localhost:80`)
